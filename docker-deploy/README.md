# Deployment by Docker Compose

## Prerequisites
1. Docker: 18
2. Docker-Compose: 1.24
3. [The FATE Images](https://github.com/FederatedAI/FATE/tree/contributor_1.0_docker/docker-build) have been built and downloaded by nodes.

## Deploying FATE
Use the following command to clone repo if you did not clone before:
```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:FederatedAI/KubeFATE.git
```
By default, the script pulls the images from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/search?q=federatedai&type=image) during the deployment.

### Use Third Party Registry (Optional)
It is recommended that non-Internet clusters use Harbor as a third-party registry. Please refer to [this guide](https://github.com/FederatedAI/KubeFATE/blob/master/registry/install_harbor.md) to install Harbor. Change the `THIRDPARTYPREFIX` to [Harbor](https://goharbor.io/) hostname in the `.env` file. `192.168.10.1` is an example of Harbor IP.
```bash
$ cd KubeFATE/
$ vi .env

THIRDPARTYPREFIX=192.168.10.1/federatedai
```

### Configure Parties
The following steps will illustrate how to deploy two parties on different hosts.

### Generate startup files
Before starting the FATE system, the user needs to define their parties in configuration file `./docker-configuration.sh`. 

The following sample of `docker-configuration.sh` defines two parities, they are party `10000` hosted on a machine *192.168.7.1* and `9999` hosted on a machine *192.168.7.2*.
```bash
user=root
venvdir=/data/projects/fate/venv
dir=/data/projects/fate
partylist=(10000 9999)
partyiplist=(192.168.7.1 192.168.7.2)
exchangeip=proxy
```

Use the following command to deploy each party. Before running the command, ***please make sure host 192.168.7.1 and 192.168.7.2 allow password-less SSH access with SSH key***:
```bash
$ bash docker-auto-deploy.sh
```
If using a third-party registry, use the following command to generate deployment files:
```bash
$ bash docker-auto-deploy.sh useThirdParty
```

The script will copy "10000-confs.tar" and "9999-confs.tar" to host 192.168.7.1 and 192.168.7.2.

Afterward the script will log in to these hosts and use docker-compose command to start the FATE cluster.

Once the command returns, log in to any host and use `docker ps` to verify the status of cluster, an example output is as follows:

```

```

### Verify the Deployment
Since the `confs-10000_python_1` container hosts the `fate-flow` service, so we need to perform the test within that container. Use the following commands to launch:
```bash
$ docker exec -it confs-10000_python_1 bash
$ source venv/bin/activate
$ cd python/examples/toy_example/
$ python run_toy_example.py 10000 9999 1
```
If the test passed, the screen will print some messages like the follows:
```
